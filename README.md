### Planning-and-Development-Cases---City-of-Scottsdale

The City of Scottsdale publishes a [dataset](http://data.scottsdaleaz.gov/dataset/planning-and-development-cases)* that includes planning and development cases dating back to the 1970s.  I'm interested in what sorts of trends I can infer about the development of Scottsdale by looking at this dataset.

#### Questions:
1.  What is the general trend in cases being approved/denied?
2.  Are specific City Councils more contentious than others? (more likely to vote against proposals)
3.  Does the count of cases each year track with the development of Scottsdale over time?  I.E. can the future development of Scottsdale be predicted based on City Council activity?

#### Results:
1. 

#### Other things to consider: 
1.
